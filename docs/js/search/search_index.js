component to show a country picker with localizable names, inspired by Paldom/angular2-countrypicker\nInstallation\nTo install this library, run:\nbash\n$ npm install ngx-country-picker --save\nor with Yarn :\nbash\n$ yarn add ngx-country-picker\nConsuming the Country Picker\nAdd the CountryPickerModule to your Angular AppModule:\n```typescript\nimport { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\nimport { AppComponent } from './app.component';\n// Import your library\nimport { CountryPickerModule } from 'ngx-country-picker';\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [\n    AppComponent\n  ],\n  imports: [\n    BrowserModule,\n    // Import here\n    CountryPickerModule.forRoot()\n  ],\n  providers: [],\n  bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})\nexport class AppModule { }\n```\nOnce CountryPicker is imported, you can use the component in your Angular application:\n```html\n\n\n  {{title}}\n\n\n```\n\nYou can also use the CountryPickerService to import the list of countries in your app:\n```typescript\nexport class YourComponent {\n  public countries: ICountry[] = [];\n  ...\n  constructor(protected countryPicker: CountryPickerService) {\n  }\n  ...\n  public ngOnInit(): void {\n    this.countryPicker.getCountries()\n      .subscribe((countries: ICountry[]) => this.countries = countries);\n  }\n
